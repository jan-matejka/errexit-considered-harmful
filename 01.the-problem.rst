call tree::

    01  +  main
        |
    02  +--- fx
        |
    03  +--- fy && fz     ; compound command creating "errexit
             |            ; cancelling context" -> main will continue
             |            ; execution when fy fails
             |
    04       + f_failing
             |
    05       + f_other    ; the "errexit canceling context" from 03 is still
                          ; on and can't be canceled
                          ; -> if f_failing fails, the fy will still
                          ; continue executing


And later, eg when refactoring, this results in Action at distance [4]_
anti-pattern.
